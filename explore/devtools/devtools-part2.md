### DevTools - Debugging
The Lab 4 DevTools siteLinks to an external site. contains a simple program that calculates the sum of two input numbers. However, the program is not functioning as expected. You will be using the Chrome DevTools to debug the Javascript code to fix this program.

Note: Do not debug using console.log(). Practice using the Debugging tool in the Chrome DevTools for this exercise.

During your debugging process, include the following screenshots:

When the debugger is triggered, set a breakpoint at the initialization of the local variable result in calculateSum(). Take a screenshot of the list of breakpoints containing the breakpoint you just added. Name it result-calculateSum.png (or whatever image extension you would like to use) and add it to your expand/screenshots directory.
Add watch expressions to find the value of num1 and num2, and the data type of result. Take a screenshot of the watch expressions list. Name it result-dataType.png (or whatever image extension you would like to use) and add it to your expand/screenshots directory.
Answer the following questions:
