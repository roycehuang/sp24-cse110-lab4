### DevTools - Debugging

Answer the following questions:

What was the bug?
- the bug was that the result was concatenating num1 and num2 because when getting the value from the document, they are both of type string
  

How would you fix it? 
- I would fix it by type casting the inputs to become numbers so it would actually perform numerical addition, I have a photo attached in the expand/screenshots directory
